### Hello,
<p> </p>

I am a doctoral researcher at the [chair of applied statistics](https://www.wiwiss.fu-berlin.de/fachbereich/vwl/angewandte-statistik/Team/mitarbeiter_innen/hanzl/index.html){:target="_blank"} of the FU Berlin's economics department. From 2020 to 2023, I was part of the gaduate school "Political Economy of Inequality" at the [Institute for Socioeconomics](https://www.uni-due.de/soziooekonomie/hanzl){:target="_blank"} of the University of Duisburg-Essen. 

I hold a masterâ€™s degree in economics from the WU Vienna University of Economics and Business. I am also a research fellow at the [Momentum Institut](https://www.momentum-institut.at/author/lisa-hanzl){:target="_blank"}.

My main research interests are inequality, specifically in regards to gender and race, and applied microeconometrics. I am also interested labor economics, with a focus on labor supply and unemployment. 

Feel free to contact me via [mail](mailto:lisa.hanzl@fu-berlin.de){:target="_blank"}.
