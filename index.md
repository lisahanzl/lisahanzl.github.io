### Hello,
<p> </p>

I am a PhD candidate at the [Institute for Socioeconomics](https://www.uni-due.de/soziooekonomie/hanzl){:target="_blank"} of the University of Duisburg-Essen. I hold a masterâ€™s degree in economics from the WU Vienna University of Economics and Business. I am also a research assistant at the JKU Linz and a research fellow at the [Momentum Institut](https://www.momentum-institut.at/author/lisa-hanzl){:target="_blank"}.

My main research interests are labor economics, especially topics around unemployment, and applied microeconometrics. I am also interested in inequality, specifically in regards to gender and race. 

Feel free to contact me via [mail](mailto:lisa.hanzl@icloud.com){:target="_blank"}.
