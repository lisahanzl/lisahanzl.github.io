### Hello,

I am a PhD student at the [Institute for Socioeconomics](https://www.uni-due.de/soziooekonomie/hanzl){:target="_blank"} of the University of Duisburg-Essen. Currently, I am a visiting researcher at the Economics Department of the Yale University. I am also part of the [Momentum Institut](https://www.momentum-institut.at/author/lisa-hanzl){:target="_blank"}.

My main research interests are labor economics, especially labor supply issues and unemployment insurance, and applied microeconometrics. I am also interested in topics around inequality, especially in regards to gender and race. My dissertation revolves around gendered dynamics on labor markets.

Feel free to contact me via [mail](mailto:lisa.hanzl@uni-due.de){:target="_blank"}.
